This goal of this project is to create a version of Freecell using Java Swing. 

I wanted to create the GUI programmatically rather than using a GUI builder in order to learn more about using 
absolute layout (vs. using a layout manager). At the moment, all game logic is working correctly but I still 
need to outline the Freecells and foundations, as well as relocate the cells to the top of the card table. 

At the moment, the "free cells" and "foundations" (where Aces go to start a sequential pile for each suit) are not visible, but are located in the empty columns (9 and 10 respectively) to the right of the card cascades. If you want to try this game out, 
compile and run the CardTable.java class file.
