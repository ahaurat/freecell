This is a project I'm currently working on to create a version of Freecell using Java Swing. 

I wanted to create the GUI programmatically rather than using a GUI builder in order to learn more about using 
absolute layout (vs. using a layout manager). At the moment, all game logic is working correctly but I still 
need to outline the Freecells and foundations, as well as relocate the cells to the top of the card table. 

At the moment, the free cells and foundations are not visible but are found in the empty columns
(9 and 10 respectively) to the right of the card cascades. If you want to compile and play the game, 
compile and run the CardTable.java class file.
